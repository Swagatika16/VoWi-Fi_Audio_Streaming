# ðŸ“ž Realtime VoWi-Fi Audio Streaming

This project implements a basic Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWi-Fi) system using Java socket programming. It allows real-time audio transmission from a client-side microphone to a server for immediate playback within a local network. The system achieves low-latency communication, streaming audio at 16 kbps with less than 50 ms delay, demonstrating the core concepts of VoWi-Fi technology. Key features include seamless client-server communication, continuous audio streaming, and a user-friendly interface for efficient audio interactions.
